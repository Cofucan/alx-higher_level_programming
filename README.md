## Technologies Used

The Python scripts were built with **Python 3.11.2** but are also tested in a virtual environment using Python 3.8.5 as instructed.

- [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/): A Unix shell, similar to Bash.
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/): A programming tool for memory debugging, leak detection and profiling.
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/): Compiler for C/C++.
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): Utility tool that I use for running repetitive commands.
- [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty): Holberton-style C code checker written in Perl.
- [GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/): Command-line debugger that works with many low level languages including C/C++.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/): An upgraded version of the VIM code editor.
- [Lunarvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/): An IDE layer for Neovim with sane defaults. Completely free and community driven.
- [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install): Windows OS feature, by Microsoft, that enables Linux to be run natively on Windows.

Some scripts need more specific requirements, but these will be shown where they are needed.

## Projects

Here is the complete list of projects in this repository, each project has its description in its respective folder.

- [0x00. Python - Hello, World](https://github.com/Cofucan/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world)
- [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](https://github.com/Cofucan/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)

## Usage

Each project and task contains the instructions to compile the code and execute the results.

## Inspiration

The format for the Readme files in this project was heavily inspired by [Santiago Arboleda](https://github.com/monoprosito), a former student of Holberton School Software Engineering.
